## Essence
Assessing our way of working, we believe it is currently at the “In Place” state. The team is actively using the selected tools and practices to perform real work, and they are consistently applied by everyone. All team members have access to the required tools and are involved in the inspection and adaptation of the way of working. To improve further, we need to fully adopt the practices so they are applied naturally, without conscious effort.
